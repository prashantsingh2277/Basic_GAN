# Basic_GAN
Importing Libraries: The code begins by importing the required libraries, including PyTorch modules for data handling, neural networks, and optimization, as well as visualization libraries.

Visualization Function: The show function is a utility function to visualize a grid of images. It takes a tensor of image data and displays a grid of images using matplotlib.

Setting Up Parameters: Various hyperparameters and settings are initialized, including the number of epochs, the size of the noise vector (z_dim), learning rate (lr), batch size (bs), and the device to run the code on (CPU in this case).

Data Loading: The MNIST dataset is loaded using the DataLoader from torchvision. MNIST contains images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels) and is widely used for testing GANs due to its simplicity.

Declaring Models: The generator and discriminator are defined using neural network classes. The generator takes random noise vectors as input and generates fake images, while the discriminator takes real or fake images and attempts to classify them as real (1) or fake (0).

Training Loop: The main training loop begins with nested loops: an outer loop over the number of epochs and an inner loop over the batches of data from the MNIST dataset.

Discriminator Training: The discriminator is trained to distinguish between real images from the dataset and fake images generated by the generator. The discriminator's loss is calculated and used to update the discriminator's parameters.

Generator Training: The generator is trained to fool the discriminator by generating images that the discriminator classifies as real. The generator's loss is calculated based on the discriminator's output for the generated fake images. The generator's parameters are then updated using backpropagation.

Visualization and Statistics: During training, the losses of the generator and discriminator are accumulated and averaged over a certain number of steps (info_step). At each info_step, the average losses are displayed along with a visualization of some generated and real images.

Saving Models: After training, the final state of the generator and discriminator models is saved to 'generator.pth' and 'discriminator.pth', respectively.
